## Introduction

This is home to any small projects that I've completed. These tend to be smaller projects that may have only taken a few hours to complete. 
Usually, I undertake these to practice a specific skill, or as a short break from the current large project I'm working on. They tend to be very simple and easy to replicate.

This repository is unlikely to have frequent uploads as it's more of a storage place to clean up my GitHub.
